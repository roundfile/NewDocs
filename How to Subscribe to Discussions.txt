# How to Subscribe to Artisan Discussions
Artisan has established a Discussions page on Github where users can ask questions and the community can participate in answering.  This is the preferred method for getting help.  Unlike a traditional mailing list you can choose how you want to see and follow posts.

### Pull method
Visit the Discussions page at any time with a web browser to see new and old discussions.  You do not need to register with Github to view the Discussions page.  If you wish to participate by making a post you will need to create a Github account.

### Push method
Receive notifications when new posts are made to the Discussions page.  You must have a Github account to recieve notifications.  You can control when notifications are sent, for instance you can recieve them each time there is a new post to the Discussions page or limit them to only updates on your posts or when you are mentioned.  Replying to the notification email will create a reply post in that Discussion. 

### Settings to Subscribe to Notifications
To manage your notificatinon settings you must have a Github account and be signed in.  Go to the Artisan Discussions page.  Click on the "Watch" button.

Next click on "Custom" and select which notifications you wish to receive.  

### How to Turn Off Notifications
To turn off notifications from the Artisan repository click the "Unwatch" button and click "Participating and @mentions" in the menu.  With this selection you will still recieve a notification when a new post is made to a discussion where you are a participant, or when someone mentions your usename.  

To turn of all email notifications from Github, go to your account settings, choose Notifications and then uncheck the appropriate options.
